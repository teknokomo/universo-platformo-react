# Frontend Architecture

{% hint style="info" %}
**This page is under development.** Detailed documentation will be added soon.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The frontend uses React 18 with TypeScript, Material UI 7 for components, and React Router 6 for navigation. Two template systems provide different UI layouts.

## Key Patterns

* **Template system** — `universo-template-mui` (new MUI dashboard) and `flowise-template-mui` (legacy Flowise sidebar)
* **Data fetching** — `@tanstack/react-query` for server state management
* **Internationalization** — `i18next` with EN/RU locales
* **Routing** — React Router 6 with lazy-loaded routes

## Documentation

Coming soon.
