# UPDL Node System

{% hint style="info" %}
**This section is under development.** Detailed documentation for each node type will be added progressively.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

**UPDL** (Universal Platform Description Language) is a node-based system for describing 3D scenes, game logic, and interactive content. It enables platform-agnostic content creation that can be exported to multiple engines and frameworks.

## Node Categories

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Space Nodes](space-nodes.md) | Define 3D spaces, scenes, and environments |
| [Entity Nodes](entity-nodes.md) | Create objects, characters, and interactive elements |
| [Component Nodes](component-nodes.md) | Add behaviors and properties to entities |
| [Action Nodes](action-nodes.md) | Define interactions and triggers |
| [Event Nodes](event-nodes.md) | Handle events and state changes |
| [Data Nodes](data-nodes.md) | Manage data flow and storage |

## Design Philosophy

UPDL defines seven base node types for describing virtual spaces and metaverses.

UPDL enables "write once, deploy everywhere" — create content in a unified format and export to AR.js, PlayCanvas, A-Frame, or other supported engines.
