## 2025-09-18 ‚Äî Build Fix for spaces-srv

Current focus: Restore monorepo build by fixing TS path alias errors in `@universo/spaces-srv`.

Changes applied:
- Updated `apps/spaces-srv/base/tsconfig.json` to add `paths: { "@/*": ["*"] }` with `baseUrl: "./src"`.
- Excluded `src/tests/**` from compilation to avoid fixtures affecting production build.

Outcome:
- `pnpm --filter @universo/spaces-srv build` succeeds.
- Full `pnpm build` across the workspace completes successfully (27/27).

Notes:
- Entities `Canvas`, `Space`, and `SpaceCanvas` are local to the package under `src/database/entities/` and re-exported from `src/index.ts`.

## Current Focus (2025-10-14)

**AR.js Quiz Timer Implementation - COMPLETED + CRITICAL BUG FIXED**

**Implementation Summary:**
Implemented timer functionality for AR.js quiz publications allowing quiz administrators to set time limits with automatic completion on timeout. Critical bug discovered during QA and fixed to ensure runtime activation.

**Phase 1 - Frontend UI (ARJSPublisher.jsx):**
- Added state management: `timerEnabled`, `timerMinutes`, `timerSeconds`
- Created UI section after "–ù–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∏ –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫" with toggle switch and time inputs
- Integrated save/load flow: `chatbotConfig.arjs.timerConfig = { enabled, minutes, seconds }`
- Added validation: minutes 0-60, seconds 0-59, warning when total time is 0

**Phase 2 - Backend Extraction (FlowDataService.ts):**
- Extracted `timerConfig` from `config.arjs` into `renderConfig`
- Added `timerConfig` field to `RenderConfig` TypeScript interface
- Ensured backward compatibility: undefined timerConfig handled gracefully

**Phase 3 - Template Generation (DataHandler/index.ts):**
- Generated timer HTML: fixed position top center with MM:SS countdown display
- Implemented `QuizTimer` class with start/stop/reset/onTimeUp methods
- Added warning states: 30s orange background, 10s red with pulse animation
- Integrated timer lifecycle:
  - Start: After "–ù–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –∫–≤–∏–∑" button in `showQuizAfterLeadCollection`
  - Stop: When entering results screen in `showQuizResults`
  - Reset: On quiz restart in `restartQuiz`
  - Timeout: Auto-navigate to results + save lead data in `onTimeUp` callback

**Phase 4 - Testing & Deployment:**
- Linting: publish-frt 0 errors/69 warnings, template-quiz 0 errors/48 warnings
- Fixed: Regex escape characters, ColyseusSettings interface conflict, case declarations
- Build: ‚úÖ 27/27 tasks completed successfully in 6m5s

**Phase 5 - Critical Bug Fix (QA-identified):**
- QA discovered blocker: timerConfig not passed to buildOptions in ARViewPage.tsx
- Data flow traced: UI ‚úÖ ‚Üí API ‚úÖ ‚Üí Backend ‚úÖ ‚Üí Frontend ‚ùå ‚Üí Template (blocked)
- Root cause: ARViewPage.tsx extracted timerConfig to renderConfig but didn't add to buildOptions
- Fix applied: Added `timerConfig: renderConfig.timerConfig` to buildOptions object (line 79)
- Also added timerConfig to debug console.log for troubleshooting
- Build: ‚úÖ 27/27 tasks completed successfully in 6m11s
- **Result**: Timer now properly flows through entire system and activates in runtime

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ All 6 implementation phases completed
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: Critical bug fixed - timer activation unblocked (ARViewPage.tsx)
- ‚úÖ Phase 6: Database persistence fixed - TypeScript interface updated (ARJSPublicationApi.ts)
- ‚úÖ **Full clean rebuild completed** (Phase 6 deployment)
  - Issue: timerConfig not persisting to database despite save attempts
  - Root cause: ARJSPublicationSettings interface missing timerConfig field
  - Solution: Added ITimerConfig interface and timerConfig field to settings interface
  - Added: Comprehensive logging in ARJSPublisher and PublicationApi for debugging
  - Rebuild: `pnpm build:clean` executed (27/27 tasks, 7m6.675s, no cache)
- ‚úÖ **Deployed to production** - Service restarted, online (32.3mb)
- Ready for browser cache clear and manual testing with detailed logs

**Technical Details:**
- Storage: `chatbotConfig.arjs.timerConfig` (JSON, no DB migration)
- Data flow: UI ‚Üí PublicationApi ‚Üí chatbotConfig ‚Üí FlowDataService ‚Üí renderConfig ‚Üí ARViewPage ‚Üí BuildOptions ‚Üí template
- Backward compatible: Missing timerConfig ‚Üí no timer generated
- Edge cases handled: 0:00 duration warning, no results scene fallback, duplicate save prevention

**Next Steps:**
1. Manual testing of timer functionality in production
2. Deployment via `pm2 restart universo-platformo` (requires user approval)
3. Verification of countdown, warnings, and auto-completion behavior

## Previous Focus (2025-10-14)

**Space Builder Question Limit Increase & GraphSchema Capacity Update - COMPLETED**

**Phase 1 Completion:**
- Increased maximum questions limit from 10 to 30 for quiz creation
- Updated all validation layers: UI, backend schema, controller, documentation
- Clean compilation with no errors, deployed to production

**Phase 2 Completion (Issue discovered during user testing):**
- User tested 30-question quiz generation, encountered validation error
- Error: "Array must contain at most 150 element(s)" from GraphSchema validation
- Root cause: 30 questions √ó 5 answers = 182 nodes, exceeds 150-node limit
- Solution: Updated GraphSchema limits to max(250) nodes and max(500) edges
- Mathematical basis: 212 max nodes calculated, 250 provides 18% safety margin
- Added explanatory comments documenting capacity calculation
- Updated all documentation with graph capacity specifications (4 README files)
- Fixed 120 prettier formatting errors with lint --fix
- Full rebuild completed successfully: 27/27 tasks in 5m44s
- PM2 restarted with updated code, service online and ready for testing

**Current Status:**
- All code changes implemented and deployed
- Ready for user testing with 30-question quiz generation
- Awaiting user feedback to confirm generation now works correctly

## Previous Focus (2025-09-18)

- AR.js wallpaper mode without camera: ensure background renders in A-Frame-only mode.
- Implemented wallpaper as rotating wireframe `a-sphere` with `shader: flat` and as optional `a-sky`.
- DataHandler updated to always keep wallpaper (`a-sphere` wireframe back-side) and `a-sky` visible regardless of scene ID.
- Library loading respects `cameraUsage === 'none'` (no AR.js), scene has no `arjs` attribute.

Next steps: Observe in-browser result; if transparency ordering issues appear, consider `alphaTest` tuning or `render-order`.

### i18n Normalization (2025-09-18)
- Objective: Fix UI showing raw i18n keys by aligning `useTranslation` namespaces and using relative keys.
- Completed today: normalized keys in `APICodeDialog.jsx`, `EmbedChat.jsx`, `ShareChatbot.jsx`, `chatflows/index.jsx`, `agentflows/index.jsx`, and `Configuration.jsx`.
- Convention: For `chatflows` namespace, use relative keys like `apiCodeDialog.*`, `embedChat.*`, `shareChatbot.*`, `common.*`. For `publish`, use relative keys like `arjs.*`.
# Current Active Context

**Status**: Alpha v0.30.0 (2025-01-17) - AR.js Camera Disable MVP Implemented

## Current Project Focus

**AR.js Camera Usage Settings MVP (2025-01-17)** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Implemented Changes:**
- Added "–ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä—ã" setting with "–ë–µ–∑ –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä—ã" (default) and "–°—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ–µ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ" options
- Fixed camera initialization by conditionally removing `arjs` attribute from `<a-scene>` when `cameraUsage='none'`
- Fixed HTML generation issues that caused "–∫—É—Å–æ–∫ –∫–æ–¥–∞" display artifacts
- **FIXED AR-–æ–±–æ–∏ (wallpaper) to work without camera** - major breakthrough!
- Improved UI field ordering: moved camera usage field after template selection field
- Enhanced ARJSQuizBuilder with debug logging for camera usage detection
- Successfully integrated camera disable functionality across the entire pipeline

**Technical Details:**
- Backend: FlowDataService.ts properly extracts `cameraUsage` from `chatbotConfig.arjs` 
- Frontend: ARViewPage.tsx preserves `cameraUsage` settings without fallback override
- Template: ARJSQuizBuilder.ts conditionally removes `arjs` attribute and camera entity based on `cameraUsage`
- UI: ARJSPublisher.jsx field reordering and proper conditional logic for marker/wallpaper modes

## DevOps Mode Enhancement (2025-09-19) - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Implemented Critical Safety Improvements:**
- Added PM2 fallback strategy: try `pm2 start universo-platformo` first, fallback to full command if needed
- **CRITICAL SAFETY**: Added HTTP health checks before disabling maintenance mode (prevents switching to broken app)
- Fixed nginx pager issues: added `--no-pager` flag to all nginx/systemctl commands
- Improved maintenance mode management: use existing configurations instead of recreating each time
- Enhanced error handling with rollback procedures

**Key Safety Features:**
- Application health verification: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000` must return 200
- Retry logic: up to 3 attempts with 10-second intervals before declaring failure
- Maintenance mode preservation: if health checks fail, maintenance mode stays active
- Configuration persistence: leverage existing nginx configs at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`

**DevOps Process Status:** Production-ready with zero-downtime deployment capabilities and comprehensive safety checks.

## Maintenance Page Enhancement (2025-09-19) - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Implemented Multilingual Maintenance Page:**
- Fixed encoding issues: replaced problematic symbols with emoji icons üë®‚Äçüíªüî®üöÄ
- Updated branding: "Universo Platform" ‚Üí "Universo Kiberplano" throughout
- **Automatic language detection**: Russian for ru* locales, English for all others
- Quality translations for professional maintenance communication
- Responsive design with animated loading spinner preserved

**Technical Features:**
- JavaScript language detection via `navigator.language.startsWith('ru')`
- Dynamic content updates for title, headings, and all text elements
- Maintains original visual styling with improved accessibility
- Professional messaging for both languages with appropriate tone

**Integration:**
- Updated DevOps chatmode documentation for new multilingual maintenance page
- Seamless integration with existing nginx configuration management
- Preserved file permissions and deployment workflow compatibility
- **Library Loading**: Fixed getRequiredLibraries() to conditionally load AR.js only when needed
- **Wallpaper Mode**: Fixed to work with just A-Frame when camera disabled
- Build validation: Clean compilation of template-quiz and publish-frt packages

**Root Cause Fixed:**
- Previously AR.js was initializing regardless of UI setting due to:
  1. Hardcoded `arjs="sourceType: webcam"` attribute in scene generation
  2. Always loading AR.js library through getRequiredLibraries()
- **Major Discovery**: AR-–æ–±–æ–∏ (wallpaper) were completely broken because AR.js library was disabled for cameraUsage='none'
- **Solution**: 
  1. Array-based attribute construction with conditional `arjs` attribute addition
  2. Conditional library loading - AR.js only when cameraUsage='standard'
  3. **Wallpaper mode now works with just A-Frame when camera disabled**
  4. Fixed both wallpaper and marker mode HTML generation

**Current State:**
- Camera usage setting: ‚úÖ Properly saved and loaded
- AR.js initialization: ‚úÖ Conditionally disabled when camera=none
- **AR-–æ–±–æ–∏ (wallpaper)**: ‚úÖ Now work without camera using only A-Frame
- HTML generation: ‚úÖ Clean markup without comment injection into attributes
- Library loading: ‚úÖ Conditional - only A-Frame when camera disabled, A-Frame+AR.js when camera enabled
- UI field ordering: ‚úÖ Camera usage appears after template selection  
- Debug logging: ‚úÖ Console logs track arjs attribute and library loading
- Build validation: ‚úÖ Both template-quiz and publish-frt packages compiled successfully

**User Experience Now:**
When user selects "–ë–µ–∑ –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä—ã":
- ‚ùå No camera permission requests
- ‚ùå No AR.js initialization logs in console
- ‚ùå No AR.js library loaded (saves bandwidth and loading time)
- ‚úÖ **AR-–æ–±–æ–∏ still work** - 3D wallpaper sphere with A-Frame only
- ‚úÖ Quiz functionality works normally
- ‚úÖ Clean HTML output without artifacts
- ‚úÖ Proper field ordering in UI

**Next Steps:**
- Browser testing to verify no camera permission prompt when "–ë–µ–∑ –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä—ã" is selected
- QA validation that AR.js logs are absent when camera is disabled
- **Test AR-–æ–±–æ–∏ functionality** - verify 3D wallpaper sphere appears and rotates
- Verify no "–∫—É—Å–æ–∫ –∫–æ–¥–∞" artifacts appear in browser display

**Quiz Debug Logging System Enhancement (2025-09-17)** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Analytics Page Refactor (2025-09-17)** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Implemented Changes:**
- Replaced single Chatflow selector with hierarchical Space -> Canvas selectors (auto-select first Space and first Canvas by backend order)
- Added consolidated `spacesApi` (frontend) using centralized `@universo/spaces-frt` package with `getSpaces` and `getCanvases` hitting existing server routes `/unik/:id/spaces` and `/unik/:id/spaces/:spaceId/canvases`
- Updated Analytics UI to request leads by selected Canvas (still using existing leads endpoint with `chatflowid` mapped to Canvas ID)
- Introduced dedicated phone column and refactored points column to use `lead.points` with legacy fallback to numeric `phone`
- Updated i18n (EN/RU) with new keys: `selectSpace`, `selectCanvas`, `table.phone`, and renamed Chatflow ID label to Canvas ID / ID —Ö–æ–ª—Å—Ç–∞
- Updated documentation (publish-frt README EN/RU) removing obsolete note about temporary storage of points in `lead.phone` and referencing new `lead.points`
- **API Architecture Consolidation**: Removed duplicate `packages/ui/src/api/spaces.js` file and ensured all spaces functionality uses centralized `apps/spaces-frt/base/src/api/spaces.js` with proper exports
- Fixed runtime error "F.map is not a function" by adding defensive parsing for API response format `{success, data: {spaces}}` vs expected array
 - **Post-merge Improvements (2025-09-17)**: Addressed GitHub bot recommendations: added explicit dependency `@universo/spaces-frt` to `analytics-frt` package.json and refactored `Analytics.jsx` extracting `normalizeSpacesResponse` & `resolveLeadPoints` helpers (replacing inline ternaries & IIFE) for readability & testability.
 - **Tracking Artifacts (2025-09-17)**: Created Issue #410 and PR #412 (GH410) to formalize the bot recommendation refactor (explicit dependency + helper extraction). PR includes `Fixes #410` for automatic closure upon merge.

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Error diagnosis and fix for white page crash
- ‚úÖ API consolidation using centralized spaces-frt package 
- ‚úÖ Defensive response parsing for wrapped API responses
- ‚úÖ Package cleanup and proper import architecture
- ‚úÖ Successful builds of all affected packages

**Rationale:** Align analytics with Space+Canvas domain model, improve disambiguation where multiple canvases share names across Spaces, maintain clean package separation per refactoring strategy, and finalize transition to dedicated `points` column.


**Implemented Features:**
- ‚úÖ Introduced dual-layer debug control: build-time `QUIZ_DEBUG` constant and mutable runtime `QUIZ_DEBUG_STATE`
- ‚úÖ Added `dbg()` utility wrapper gating all non-error logs
- ‚úÖ Added public runtime API `window.setQuizDebug(true|false)` for live toggling without rebuild
- ‚úÖ Converted all previous ‚Äúkey‚Äù production logs (init, results, lead save attempt/success, scene transitions) to conditional debug logs
- ‚úÖ Retained `console.error` for genuine error conditions only
- ‚úÖ Updated English README with "Debug Logging" section
- ‚úÖ Added Russian localized `README-RU.md` with synchronized guidance
- ‚úÖ Verified CJS/ESM/types builds produce no stray logs when debug disabled

**Architecture Decision:** Replace noisy unconditional logging with an opt-in layered system enabling deep diagnostics on demand while keeping production console output clean (errors only). Runtime toggle chosen to avoid rebuild cycles during troubleshooting sessions.

**Implemented Features:**
- ‚úÖ Root cause analysis: initial regression where no lead saved if no form; subsequent duplication risk via dual showQuizResults paths
- ‚úÖ Guarded saving moved into `showQuizResults` (primary for results-ending quizzes)
- ‚úÖ Immediate save retained only for non-results endings (basic record fallback)
- ‚úÖ Added origin-tagged logging (`results-completion-path`, `results-navigation-path`, `no-results-ending`, `unknown`)
- ‚úÖ Extended payload logging (pre-payload, payload, warnings if IDs null)
- ‚úÖ Removed second navigation-path invocation of `showQuizResults` to prevent double call race
- ‚úÖ Global `leadSaved` flag still enforced for deduplication
- ‚úÖ Rebuilt `@universo/template-quiz` (CJS/ESM/types) with successful TypeScript compilation
- ‚úÖ Added quiet logging mode (QUIZ_DEBUG=false) + dbg() wrapper, removed verbose scene/object enumeration & point spam

**Technical Implementation:**
- Guarded save executed inside `showQuizResults(totalPoints, fromCompletionFlag)`; basic record synthesized when no form submitted
- Non-results completions perform immediate guarded save (maintains previous analytics behavior)
- Origin parameter threaded through `saveLeadDataToSupabase(‚Ä¶, origin)` for observability
- Removed redundant post-navigation `showQuizResults` trigger; only `showCurrentScene` handles results scene display
- Detailed console tracing enables verification of single POST request

**Architecture Decision:**
Shift from single centralized completion save to context-aware saving (results vs non-results) to resolve timing issues rendering results scene while still guaranteeing exactly one persisted lead (with points). Enhanced observability chosen over silent logic to accelerate future diagnostics.
