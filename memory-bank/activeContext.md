## Current Focus: Metahubs — Attributes and UI polish (Completed)

**Status**: Recent work completed; awaiting next concrete focus.

### Summary (2026-01-23)
- Attribute limit (100) enforced in backend; UI shows info banner and disables Add at limit.
- Attribute list supports locale-aware sorting and localized search; record columns follow `sortOrder`.
- Metahub list shows `codename`; menu divider support added for metahub navigation.

### Next Step
- Define the next Metahubs-related focus and log it in `tasks.md`; keep historical details in `progress.md`.
