## AR.js Quiz Timer Implementation (2025-10-14)

Objective: Add timer functionality to AR.js quiz publications with configuration UI in publication window. Timer starts after "Начать квиз" button, displays countdown, and auto-redirects to final statistics on timeout.

### Phase 5: Critical Bug Fix (QA-identified blocker)
- [x] Fix timerConfig not passed to buildOptions in ARViewPage.tsx
   - File: `apps/publish-frt/base/src/pages/public/ARViewPage.tsx`
   - Location: Line ~79-80 (inside buildOptions object construction)
   - Bug: timerConfig extracted to renderConfig but NOT included in buildOptions
   - Impact: Timer never activates in runtime despite correct UI/backend/template code
   - Fix: Added `timerConfig: renderConfig.timerConfig,` after backgroundColor line
   - Also added timerConfig to debug console.log for better troubleshooting
   - Priority: CRITICAL - blocks all timer functionality ✅ FIXED
- [x] Rebuild publish-frt package
   - Command: `pnpm --filter publish-frt build`
   - Result: ✅ TypeScript compilation successful, no errors
- [x] Run full workspace build
   - Command: `pnpm build`
   - Result: ✅ Tasks: 27 successful, 27 total in 6m11s
   - Changes applied across all dependencies

### Phase 1: Frontend UI Implementation (ARJSPublisher.jsx)

   - Added state: `timerEnabled`, `timerMinutes`, `timerSeconds` with defaults (false, 5, 0)
- [x] Create timer configuration UI section
   - Location: After "Настройки библиотек" section (line ~923)
   - Added Switch component for enable/disable toggle
   - Added TextField components for minutes and seconds with validation
   - Added Grid layout for side-by-side inputs
- [x] Integrate timer config into save/load flow
   - Method: `saveCurrentSettings` - added timerConfig to ChatflowsApi.saveSettings

- ✅ Phase 2: Backend extraction configured in FlowDataService.ts with timerConfig support
- ✅ Phase 3: Template timer generation implemented in DataHandler with QuizTimer class
- ✅ Phase 4: Linting passed (0 errors), full build successful (27/27 tasks in 6m5s)
- ✅ Phase 5: Critical bug fixed - timerConfig now properly passed to buildOptions in ARViewPage.tsx (27/27 tasks in 6m11s)
- ✅ **Deployed**: PM2 restart successful, service online (26.5mb memory)

**Critical fix applied:**
- Added `timerConfig: renderConfig.timerConfig` to buildOptions object in ARViewPage.tsx
- This unblocks timer activation in runtime - timer now works correctly when configured
- Added debug logging for timerConfig to improve troubleshooting

**Deployment status:**

# Tasks Tracker
## Current Implementation - i18n keys show in UI (2025-09-18)

### Objective
Fix incorrect i18n namespaces/usages causing raw keys to appear in UI for Publish AR.js and API dialogs.

### Plan
- [x] ARJSPublisher: switch to `useTranslation('publish')` and use relative keys (`arjs.*`)
- [x] APICodeDialog: remove redundant `chatflows.` prefix in `t()` calls; use relative keys (`apiCodeDialog.*`)
- [x] PythonCode/LinksCode: use `useTranslation('chatflows')` and relative keys (`apiPython.*`, `apiLinks.*`)
 - [x] Chatflows views (EmbedChat, ShareChatbot, index, Configuration, Agentflows): normalize to relative keys to avoid double prefix
 - [x] Validate build/lint for changed files and smoke test translations

### Notes
- `packages/ui/src/i18n/index.js` registers namespaces: `publish`, `chatflows`, etc. Components must use the correct namespace without duplicating it in keys.
 - Completed normalization fixes eliminate visible raw keys in top-right API dialog and embed/share panels.


## Current Implementation - QR Code Download Notification Fix (2025-09-18)

### Objective
Fix missing notification when QR code download completes successfully.

- English: "QR code saved successfully"
- Russian: "QR-код успешно сохранён"

### [x] Task 4: Build and Deploy
- Successfully built publish-frt with updated QR code notification
- QR code download now shows proper user feedback

## Camera Usage Mode Simplification (Previous)

### [x] Task 1: Fix AR.js Scene Initialization
- Remove `arjs` attribute from `<a-scene>` when `cameraUsage='none'`
- Update both wallpaper and marker modes in ARJSQuizBuilder.ts
- Add debug console logging to track attribute removal

### [x] Task 2: Fix UI Field Ordering
- Move "Использование камеры" field to appear after "Шаблон экспорта" 
- Reorder FormControl components in ARJSPublisher.jsx
- Maintain all existing conditional logic and functionality

### [x] Task 3: Enhance Debug Logging  
- Add console logs in ARJSQuizBuilder to track `cameraUsage` value
- Log whether `arjs` attribute is added or removed
- Help troubleshoot camera initialization issues

### [x] Task 4: Fix HTML Generation Issues
- Fixed invalid HTML generation causing "кусок кода" artifacts

## Previous Fix - AR.js Internationalization (2025-01-17)

### Objective
Fix translation issues in AR.js published applications where language keys were showing instead of translated text during loading.

## Previous Fix - Quiz Lead Saving Fix Implementation  

### Objective
Fix quiz lead saving functionality to ensure quiz completion always creates exactly one lead record.

### AR.js Internationalization Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Problem**: When opening published AR.js applications (localhost:3000/p/[id]), users saw language keys like 'general.loading' instead of translated text during loading screens.

**Root Cause**: 
- useTranslation() hooks called without namespace specification
- Translation key mismatches between code and language files

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Fixed PublicFlowView.tsx**: Updated useTranslation('publish'), corrected 'common.loading' → 'general.loading'
- ✅ **Fixed ARViewPage.tsx**: Updated useTranslation('publish'), corrected 'publish.arjs.loading' → 'arjs.loading'  
- ✅ **Added Missing Keys**: Added 'applicationNotAvailable' to both Russian and English translation files
- ✅ **Package Rebuild**: Successfully compiled publish-frt package
- ✅ **Full Workspace Build**: Applied changes across all dependent packages

**Result**: Loading screens now display proper translated text instead of raw language keys.

## Previous Fix - Quiz Lead Saving Fix Implementation

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Problem Identified
After initial fix for duplicate records, quiz completion stopped creating ANY lead records due to overly restrictive `leadData.hasData` condition.

### Root Cause
- Lead saving was conditional on `leadData.hasData = true`
- This flag was only set when lead collection form was used
- Quizzes without lead forms never set `hasData = true`, so no records were saved

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Universal Lead Saving
- ✅ **Always Save Lead**: Modified logic to save lead record on every quiz completion
- ✅ **Basic Record Creation**: Create lead record with null values when no form data collected
- ✅ **Points Preservation**: Always save quiz points regardless of lead form presence

#### 2. Updated Logic Flow
- ✅ **Form Data Check**: Check if `leadData.hasData` is false (no form used)
- ✅ **Basic Record Setup**: Set name/email/phone to null for basic completion tracking
- ✅ **Enable Saving**: Set `hasData = true` to enable saveLeadDataToSupabase call
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Maintain existing `leadSaved` global flag protection

#### 3. Implementation Details
```typescript
// Always save lead data when quiz completes, regardless of ending type
// If no lead form data was collected, save basic completion record
if (!leadData.hasData) {
    // Create basic lead record for quiz completion tracking
    leadData.name = null;
    leadData.email = null;
    leadData.phone = null;
    leadData.hasData = true; // Enable saving
    console.log('[MultiSceneQuiz] No lead form used, creating basic completion record');
}
saveLeadDataToSupabase(leadData, pointsManager.getCurrentPoints());
```

#### 4. Build and Validation
- ✅ **Package Rebuild**: Successfully compiled template-quiz with ESM and CJS outputs
- ✅ **Code Verification**: Confirmed changes applied in compiled JavaScript files
- ✅ **Expected Result**: Every quiz completion now creates exactly one lead record

### Files Modified
- `apps/template-quiz/base/src/arjs/handlers/DataHandler/index.ts` - Universal lead saving logic
- Generated outputs: `dist/esm/` and `dist/cjs/` - Updated via build process

## Previous Implementation - Duplicate Prevention (2025-01-17)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (with follow-up fix above)

### Duplicate Record Fix
- ✅ **Global Flag**: Added `leadSaved` variable to prevent duplicate saves
- ✅ **Centralized Logic**: Moved lead saving to main quiz completion handler
- ✅ **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate call from showQuizResults function
- ✅ **Race Condition Protection**: Global flag prevents timing issues

## Final Status: RESOLVED ✅

Quiz lead saving now works correctly:
- **Every quiz completion** creates exactly **one lead record**
- **Form-based leads** save collected name/email/phone data

# Task Tracking

**Project**: Universo Platformo (v0.29.0-alpha, Alpha achieved)
**Current Focus**: TypeScript Path Aliases Refactoring

## TypeScript Path Aliases Refactoring Plan (2025-09-16) ✅

**Goal**: Standardize imports across the monorepo by replacing long relative paths (`../../../../../`) with clean aliases (`@ui/*`, `@types/*`, `@utils/*`).

### Implementation Tasks:
- [x] Document plan in memory-bank/tasks.md
- [x] Analyze current tsconfig.json files
- [x] Create import analysis tool
- [x] Refactor finance-frt (current file)
- [x] Refactor profile-frt
- [x] Refactor resources-frt
- [x] Refactor analytics-frt
- [x] Refactor auth-frt
- [x] Validation and testing
- [x] Final consistency check

**Priority Patterns:**
- `@ui/*` - UI components from packages/ui
- `@types/*` - Types from universo-platformo-types
- `@utils/*` - Utilities from universo-platformo-utils
- `@api/*`, `@components/*`, `@hooks/*`, `@pages/*` - Local modules

**Reference Configurations:** spaces-frt, metaverses-frt (already working)

## New Task - Flow List i18n (2025-09-15)

Internationalize shared Flow List (table + menu) without polluting root translation files.

### Subtasks
- [x] Create namespace files `flowList.json` (EN/RU)
- [x] Register `flowList` namespace in `i18n/index.js`
- [x] Refactor `FlowListMenu.jsx` to use translations
- [x] Refactor `FlowListTable.jsx` to use translations
- [x] Add plural keys (en/ru) & fix usage in `FlowListTable.jsx`
- [x] Add date formatting utility skeleton `formatDate.js`
- [x] Introduce action types `entityActions.ts`
- [x] Add `BaseEntityMenu.tsx` skeleton (not yet integrated)

## Fix - Spaces Canvas Back Navigation (2025-09-15)

Issue: Clicking the back (exit) icon in a Space canvas redirected to root `/` (Uniks list) instead of the current Unik's Spaces list after migration to singular route pattern.

Root Cause: `CanvasHeader.jsx` still parsed legacy segment `'uniks'` to extract `unikId`. With new routes using `/unik/:unikId/...`, extraction failed and fallback navigated to `/`.

Resolution:
- Added helper `extractUnikId()` in `CanvasHeader.jsx` to support both new `unik` and legacy `uniks` path segments, plus fallbacks (chatflow.unik_id, localStorage `parentUnikId`).
- Updated back button handler and settings actions (delete space, export as template, duplicate) to use the helper.
- Ensures proper navigation to `/unik/{unikId}/spaces` (or `/unik/{unikId}/agentflows` for agent canvases).

Status: ✅ Implemented & built (spaces-frt + ui).

Follow-ups (optional):
- Add integration test around navigation helper.
- Persist last visited tab or filter state when returning to list (TODO candidate).

### Notes
- Reused cancel button key from confirm.delete.cancel to avoid duplicate generic button keys.
- Entity dynamic label resolved via `entities.chatflow` / `entities.agent`.
- Export filename uses localized entity suffix.


## Active Task - Fix Metaverses Localization Button Keys (2025-01-13)

Fix translation keys across metaverses components to match resources-frt patterns.

- [x] Compare localization patterns between metaverses-frt and resources-frt
- [x] Fix translation keys in 6 components (MetaverseDetail, SectionDetail, EntityDetail, EntityDialog)
- [x] Test button text display for proper translations

**Fixes Applied:** Changed `metaverses.entities.*` → `entities.*` and `metaverses.entities.common.back` → `common.back` across components.

## Active Issues

### Metaverse Integration Issues (2025-08-14)

**Status**: 🔍 Analysis In Progress | **Type**: Level 2 Integration Fix | **Urgency**: High

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Missing Metaverse Menu Item**

   - [ ] Add appropriate icon import for metaverse

2. **Profile Migration Trigger Conflict**
   - [x] Analysis: Migration `AddProfile1741277504477` fails with trigger already exists error
   - [x] Root Cause: `create_profile_trigger` already exists in Supabase database
   - [ ] Fix migration to handle existing triggers gracefully
   - [ ] Test full integration after fixes
